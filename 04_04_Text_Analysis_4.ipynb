                The screen is easily readable in the sun, and I love how it automatically dims to 20% at night .\\n3                                                                Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n4          The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n5                                                                                The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n6

                                                                                                                                            If you are looking for a simple wide screen GPS the Nuvi 255W is the right choice .\\n8                                                                                                                    One of my favorite features on the Garmin 255W is the odometer screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .\\n9                                                                                                                                             It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                         Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .\\n11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                         ,  255w has an arrow at the top of the screen that shows the direction of the next turn .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                        To make things worse, in the the  Main st  may not be on the screen on the default scale .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16                                                                                      The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                             The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n19

the map, you can zoom in or out by tapping the appropriate icon located on the top right of the screen .\\n25                                                                           I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n26                                                                                                                                                               If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .\\n27                                                                                                                                               So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n28

                            I use the suction cup mount because I like to keep the screen in my frame of vision without turning my head, but I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .\\n36

                                                                                                                         I chose a hard type of case that zippered the screen in, as I didn't want the possibility of it sliding out .\\n43                                                                                                                                             Also, it's hard to view the screen when it's super sunny outside, but the text to speech capability is an advantage .\\n44                                                                                                                         Before I get into the specifics of my review, let me offer one important piece of advice , ,  BUY A CARRYING CASE to protect the screen !\\n45                                                                                                 These gadgets have sensitive touchscreen menus, and I think the fact that I didn't protect the screen on my last GPS is the reason it died after only 14 months .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                             I had a Nuvi 205 and I really liked it but I wanted a bigger screen .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                 It's an emergency location feature ,  you can tap the screen to get your latitude and longitude .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                       BUT, in direct sunlight, the screen is difficult to see in my convertible .\\n49                                                                                                                             Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n50                                                                                                                                        The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                    One thing that would be useful is putting a mute button on the screen available at all times .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n53                                                                                                                                     I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .\\n56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                              The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .\\n63                                                             If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .\\n64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .\\n67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .\\n68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .\\n69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Sufficiently sensitive touch screen\\n76                                                                                                                                                          Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                             We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .\\n78                                                                                                                                                           The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen size makes it really easy to see without being a safety hazard .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                    The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                       The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .\\n82

       I've only used the wide screen versions, so I can't compare, but I personally wouldn't want to go to a smaller screen .\\n102                                                                               The Garmin nuvi 255W I bought through Amazon has a dead red pixel which is always on and what is worse is that the position of that red dot is right in the middle of the screen .\",\n

not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

                                       All features worked excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .\\n42

                                 the screen is STUNNING, and if you've got a bright light shining down on it, you've got a choice :\\n44

come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47

want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49

features  impressed me .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

                                                      The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57

easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

                               The only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .\\n137

should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a

to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

more visible .\\n165

standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

                The screen is easily readable in the sun, and I love how it automatically dims to 20% at night .\\n3                                                                Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n4          The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n5                                                                                The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n6

                                                                                                                                            If you are looking for a simple wide screen GPS the Nuvi

                                 It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                         Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .\\n11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n12

                                                                                                                        To make things worse, in the the  Main st  may not be on the screen on the

way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16                                                                                      The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18

that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n26                                                                                                                                                               If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the

doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n28

                            I use the suction cup mount because I like to keep the screen in my frame of vision without turning my head, but I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .\\n36

was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n53                                                                                                                                     I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .\\n56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                              The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .\\n63                                                             If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .\\n64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .\\n67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .\\n68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .\\n69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Sufficiently sensitive touch screen\\n76                                                                                                                                                          Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                             We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .\\n78                                                                                                                                                           The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .\\n79

                                                                                                                                              The background of the screen turns black when it's

into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .\\n82

.\\n84                                                                                                                                                3 inches large screen is large enough for you to

                                       One down side is the lack of volume button on the unit you have to adjust the volume form the tool menu on the screen which can be a challenge if you want to change the volume when you are driving .\\n91                                                                                                                                                After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .\\n92

          The Garmin nuvi 255W I bought through Amazon has a dead red pixel which is always on and what is worse is that the position of that red dot is right in the middle of the screen .\",\n

                         The touchpad works well, the screen glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33

not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47

want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49

features  impressed me .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM

                                                 I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

                                                      The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57

                                     The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n87

easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

sized, , use fullscreen browsing .\\n91

too cramped .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen size works just fine for me .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n95

                          Factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .\\n124

        The 1024x600 screen can be set, if you wish, so that it is a 1024x600 viewport to a larger 1024x768 desktop, reachable by moving the mouse to the screen edge .\\n125

 Screen appearance is enhanced by Asus software, and I do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations .\\n127

                                             The 10 inch screen started getting to me on the Asus 1005 .\\n128

  I love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad .\\n129

different part of the screen if I accidentally touch something .\\n130

and sufficently bright for occassional use .\\n131

and the unit runs great .\\n132

resolution .\\n133                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n134

actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .\\n135

                               The only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .\\n137

                                  The screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop .\\n138

should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

The screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .\\n140

keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n141

and keyboard layout is excellent .\\n142                                                                                                                                             It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :\\n151

I can annotate while listening to the lecture .\\n152

done  the screen is glossy   .\\n153

extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\n160

              This machine is plenty fast, it's just that if I try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

probably the biggest drawback .\\n164                                                                                                                                                                                                             Could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n170

it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

                 As others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .\\n172

fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n173

iPod, many steps wiser and more able than its one, year, old  The iPod gains many incremental improvements, including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing price points of $249 for the 30GB version and $349 for the huge 80GB version   .\\n31

drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                                       There is no real parking space, so I had to pull up in front of the hotel in a small space .\\n5

cost of $42 .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                      Rooms are very comfortable and we were charged $15 for parking our motorcycle in the garage .\\n7

                                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking is easier then you might realize .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                There is a parking ramp across the street that is MUCH cheaper then hotel parking .\\n10

parking discount .\\n11                                                                                                                               Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .\\n12

                                                                                                                                                                             On the other hand, the valet parking attendant bell people were very friendly .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .\\n15

becomes a pain .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Only other downer was $38 per night for valet parking .\\n17                                                                                                                                             room was quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location\\n18                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .\\n20                                                                                                                                             Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27

                                                                                                                                                                                  First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35

disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37

and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40

excessive .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !\\n42

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44

parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50

.\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                  They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you won\\u0092t have to mess with the parking fees .\\n55

                                  The great thing for us was the free parking .\\n57

                                                                                               We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n59                                                                                                                                                          Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n60

.\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                    staff were helpful although the valet parking and the laundry costs were extremely expensive .\\n62

                                                                                                                                                            Way too much money to pay for parking, but

expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\\n67

Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking at the hotel was a hefty $32 per day with unlimited in and out privileges .\\n72

                                                    In addition, the valet parking is apparently handled by an outside contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                          Because of the exhorbitant $29 valet parking fee, we only rented a car for Sonoma and Napa for one day .\\n75

                                                                              Upon arriving, there was a very long and confusing to do with the valet parking ,  we hadn't gotten our luggage out of th car and the valet wanted the keys .\\n79

    Then we picked up the free lobby coffee and the WSJ and the USA Today newspapers, thus having a cheap breakfast .\\n66

freely available !\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                      The nightly free wine reception is a great way to meet people and find out what is worth seeing and what is not .\\n68

have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n70

meet other guests .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                      The hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why ?\\n72

                            It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n74

to participate in .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                    Every evening 5pm to 6pm, guests are invited to have free wine in the reception area and there is free coffee there every morning .\\n76    The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as a cut above, and our group, which has stayed at many a biz hotel, had no problem whatsoever  in fact, a courtesy upgrade got us a fine meeting space with free internet, which even impressed our boss .\\n77

                                                          Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n37

were both excellent .\\n38                                                                                                                                                             This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n39

                                                                                                                                           The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41

             One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                       They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   We were very impressed with the service we received .\\n48

                                                                                       Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\n50                                                                                                                                               We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51

quick .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                              very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .\\n53

                                                                                                                                                        I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55

recommend due to the room service .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\n58

    Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n61

          Overall, I think the Swissotel is a perfectly nice facility and I feel like we got a good deal but I would never consider paying full price to stay there as you can get the same amenities and service at lower rates elsewhere .\\n26

prompt and good .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                             stayed at swissotel for 5 nights ,  just myself and two children   all the staff could not have been more welcoming, the room service was prompt and efficient and not overly expensive .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3 We had an Executive Room which granted us access to the 42nd floor Executive Lounge with day, round complimentary beverage service   and pastries, and free Internet Access .\\n79

.\\n80



                                           On top of all of this, the concierge was so unhelpful and unknowledgeable that we called the W Hotel to use their services .\\n85                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In my eyes that is a step up from stealing because we did not utilize the mini bar, room service or the business center .\\n86

                Room service food quality was very good but with a $7 tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .\\n88

The staff was wonderful, our room was very comfortable with an amazing view of the Chicago River and Michigan Ave, Room service was superb   .\\n89

        I left the hotel for 4 hours in the afternoon with the do, not, disturb sign removed, but it was not serviced when I returned .\\n90

                                    Overall, the hotel is a comfortable business hotel, but could stand to improve its service .\\n91

Altogether a nice and modern business hotel with all kind of service, but nothing with individuality and charme .\\n94

One very simple, but very appreciated touch was the water service in the front lobby .\\n98

However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

         The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

had several problems .\\n56

                                  The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

the bathroom .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67

                      The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

price we survived .\\n75

                                                                                                                                                                                               The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

                                 I thought it would be fitting to christen my Kindle with the Stephen King novella UR, so went to the Amazon site on my computer and clicked on the button to buy it .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                            As soon as I'd clicked the button to confirm my order it appeared on my Kindle almost immediately !\\n1                                                                                                                After reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .\\n2                                                   I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .\\n3

press a button to turn pages .\\n4                                                                                                                                                  It took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .\\n5

owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n6                                                unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .\\n7

to press and hold two buttons to put the device to sleep .\\n8

                                                                                                                                                                                                          You need to press on the interior of the button to get it to click .\\n10

                                                                                                                                                                                                               The little power button at the top of the Kindle is really a power slide .\\n12

                                                                                                                                       sleeker look and feel  , sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again .\\n14

.\\n15                                                                                                       Only issue is I need to recalibrate now, , in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .\\n16

button later .\\n17

                                                                                                                                               The main issue I had with Kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                     I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .\\n20

the 5, way button is a major improvement .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On off buttons are repositioned to be easily accessible .\\n22    Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The second thing is the buttons .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                           This means that when you handle the Kindle 2 by the edges, the pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .\\n25                                                                                                                                              Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .\\n26                                                                                                          That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled \\u00be of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27

.\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                              It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .\\n29

get work done .\\n30                                                                                                                                      if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31

page turn buttons are better .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                   With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .\\n33

manageable size and are a lot less sensitive .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I love the 4, way directional button .\\n35                                                                  It took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A button click brings up the dictionary, starting with that entry .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .\\n39                                                                                                      The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The buttons are not hard to press at all .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Every K2 button has a satisfying \\n42                                                                                                                                       Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .\\n43                                                                                        The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,  Inside, edge buttons ,  These have saved me from accidentally pressing buttons many times .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                               The text is darker and clearer and the buttons are more like the Sony , ,  both on one side   .\\n46

especially the improved button design .\\n47

                                                                                                                                                                 The incredibly tiny buttons are literally impossible for people with low, vision to read .\\n49

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Greatly improved page turning buttons .\\n51

                                            Each time this has happened, I have contacted the support team, each time the team member has made me delete the book from the device,they've resent it to me and I've had to do the hold the power button for 20 seconds process each time .\\n53

                                               The buttons and the controller work smoothly .\\n55                                                                                           Sleek style, easy to hold, the white causes it to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                              I love how the content manager is better integrated and I don't have to hit so many buttons to manage my books .\\n57

button positioning .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              Since the K2 is longer and the buttons are near the bottom, its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When I'm trying to go to the next page, I hit the home button by accident a lot .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n61

the extra responsiveness of the K1 buttons   .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                            However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                             With the K2 I can turn on the TTS feature with one button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                        I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I worried that the new buttons would be Sony Reader size, and impossible for me to press .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                   Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67

                                         I like the new size and feel of the buttons .\\n68

                  But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .\\n70

   Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73

 buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .\\n83

with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .\\n89

detracts from your reading .\\n90

that I will get over the loss quickly .\\n92

the buttons without turning the page accidentally .\\n94                                                                                                          They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .\\n95                                                                                                                                    Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .\\n96

the lst generation that made the device hard to hold and frustratingly easy to advance the page .\\n100

rotate, which makes some PDFs readable but then you're in the awkward position of having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .\\n110

                   While not as much text fits on a screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .\\n112

way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n113

that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\\n7                              The widescreen display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the screen, , which makes it much easier to differentiate between which road to turn on when there are two streets on your right   that are only one house apart .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bad ,  My unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .\\n9                                                                                                                                       UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I also miss the display of how far you have yet to go on your route .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                  My old unit counts this down for you and provides an estimate of ETA on the map display .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                      I have to hit too many buttons to get back to the map display when, for example, I am entering POIs .\\n13                                                                                        Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n14                                                                                                     In the map view, if you touch the display button to the left of the  Menu  button  , it brings up a display that features some stats about your trip and includes a compass of sorts .\\n15                                                                                                                The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                  For me, the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .\\n17                                                                                                                    So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It also can display and speak many languages .\\n19                                                                                                                                            I am thinking about buying another one of these for my parents because their native language is Chinese and Garmin 255W speaks and display it !\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The display is great, and is very clear .\\n21                                                                                                                                                      The instructions sometimes are a little difficult to understand, but written at the top of the display is the next turn information .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                          The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n23                                                                                                                                Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .\\n24                                                                                                                                                  The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n25                                                                                                                                                              Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n26

areas I am familiar with :\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                               But is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Even setting the display to maximum detail is far from adequate .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                    I have really sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much, but there is an adjustment for it .\\n30

day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n32                                                                                                                                               ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                     The unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .\\n35

control of that as well .\\n36    I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just tells you the distance and time, though if you tap on it it will show the map so you can zoom around and see the trip as it planned it .\\n37

.\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Garmin has a nice 3d display .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                          One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I like the larger display and quicker updating of maps .\\n41                                                                                                                  I really like the versatility of picking destination points either by inputing an explicit address, uploading from Google Maps, or just touching a point on the display .\\n42

                                                              It is very easy to use, and when driving in the US  , it displays the speed limit and your speed, which is helpful when converting from

deciding whether to upgrade, do it now while you can still get a good price for your old Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever .\\n2    Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3

need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28

                        As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Disappointing given the prices .\\n31

great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45

                                                          Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                              Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50

                                                                                                                                                                                                        The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54

buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56

reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n58

                     Of the 20, several were priced higher on B&N then amazon, significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n61

                                                     Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

                                                             I feel uncomfortable driving this car and will get rid of it .\\n21

                                                 You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33

                                                           I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35

would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

                                    Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46

   Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

                                                  The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74

                                                                        Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76

    My passengers are expecially happy with it and love the room, comfort, and adjustability .\\n79                                                                                                 On longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80

             I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works

have to say the car rode great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86

                                                                                                                                                    Comfortable and quiet with excellent gas mileage

the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91

                                                The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                            It is so comfortable and drives perfect .\\n96                                                                                                              Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97

                    I only have a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats

              the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104

                 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature, and a fuel consumption that is best in the class .\\n107                                                                                                                                              Nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .\\n108

                                                          The car is VERY comfortable and the air conditioning is perfect for the heat here in Arizona .\\n110

preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40                                                                                                                                                     The car is getting great gas mileage   even though I have only been driving it 2 weeks .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                           Our 2008 Accord is very disappointing, our in town mileage is 14 .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                Gets great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                  Don't buy this car if you want good gas mileage .\\n46                                                                                                  I have a V, 6 with Variable Cylinder Management which is supposed to let the car run on 3,4 or 6 cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                             My BMW 530i got better mileage .\\n48                                                                                                   It is fun to drive, I love the color, it has great features, the sound system is nice, the power is perfect and the gas mileage is great !\\n49

driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                             I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !\\n53

                                                                                                                              It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

                                                                                                                    Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83

satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40

that was done, it was a breeze .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                           Also, as a novice user, I am really surprised at the time it takes for it to capture satellite signals, holding it up to the sky, outdoors .\\n59

the gps loses satellite reception often and confuses itself .\\n60

when dealing with one demanding internet site .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                        zoom in or zoom out of a screen  , but on occasion it will zoom when you don't want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                        The occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away  Microsoft attributes it to an errant driver, but I have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .\\n14

.\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                        If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      But with screen brightness cranked up, bluetooth & wi, fi in constant use, some video playback  , and internet radio running, I'm getting a good 8\\n25

                                               With wi, fi off & the screen dimmed, I don't think I'll have a problem getting the stated 10 .\\n26

back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n27

feels comfortable, and the screen is good .\\n31

doesn't go back far enough .\\n32

magnet .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        On full screen display is smooth and no issues .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                       Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

                              On a full charge, with wireless on, screen brightness on medium, I get a reported 8 .\\n38

surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate .\\n41

                            I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46

                                     One of the other complaints I'd come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47

                                            yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49

I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50

although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

excellent, with normal usage I can get about 7 hours easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

                 Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .\\n91

with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n92

    The screen size works just fine for me .\\n93

never needing to use it   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the

  Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

      The 10, inch screen is bright and has good color, and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n141

                                            It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is

                              But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

accidentally knocked it over, but I think it could easily be done  the screen is glossy   .\\n153

it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .\\n155

netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

                                 The small screen is probably the biggest drawback .\\n164

aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

go back .\\n168                                                                                                                                                                                           Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            One hint ,  there's a setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n170                                                                                                                                                                                                           I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

maybe it's something I need to figure out how to fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n173

          the directions didn't tell me anything I didn't already know after fiddling with it for 10 minutes .\\n2

option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It gives your heading not in terms of degres but only in terms of one of eight directions   .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                             The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Garmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I've found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I like how the Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

                                               It speaks the directions so that you don't have to keep looking down at a piece of paper .\\n15

                                 It allows for detours with directions on how to get back .\\n16

           The sound is tolerable, but when you are hearing spoken directions a lot, it gets really annoying .\\n20

voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n31

                                                                                                                                                                      It should tell me to take the Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34

the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .\\n35

skipped directions .\\n36

                                                                         The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n39

it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40

 My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42

turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

right to Carmel .\\n45

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n47

by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48

driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49

                                                                                                                                                                                    I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56

wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

             The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n70

or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

     I spent 2 weeks driving around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n75                                                                                                                                             I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing

                                                 On the negative side, the directions it gives to a given address are not always the best way to get there .\\n78

speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time .\\n20

them although you can get an external, which I have .\\n21                                                                                                                                        Small, easy to grab and go, and can do your business in places that wouldn't open a full size laptop, easy to take notes on, or keep copies of what your working on from your main PC and continue working on it where ever you are .\\n22

for the past few years, and the distance between the top of the display and the edge of the netbook when open is a practical size to get my work done on a flight .\\n24

    Everything I needed in a laptop without the heavy, bulky size .\\n27

travel, but large enough to be usable .\\n28

classes .\\n29

       Speaking of which, the keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .\\n31

only complaint is the small, compressed size of the UP and DOWN arrows, but I suppose that was probably unavoidable .\\n32

              Someone else suggested going to the store first to check out the size .\\n33

Buy or Office Max to make sure you're ok with the size .\\n34

            XP is great after a glacial Vista laptop, despite the Atom this is much faster than a full, size Vista laptop we have .\\n38

I love its small compact size and ultra portability .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                         although the screen is relatively small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          One of the things that I found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                Also tried a full size Logitech Trackman   and a little wired Logitech notebook mouse sucks like all mice but usable if a mouse is your idea of a good time .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I'm using it with a Xion 2 fan pad that folds up to about the size of the closed netbook and runs off a USB port .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And you can't beat the price with a stick compared to a full size laptop or desktop .\\n54                                                                                                                                                      The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The keyboard is excellent and even though only 92% the size of a full size keyboard, feels like the big one .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The overall size is just perfect for what I wanted .\\n57

be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n60

lightweight, small size of this product .\\n61



                                                                                                                          Because of its size and ease of travel ,  pretty soon this became an important part of my wife's professional life and she was using it for work, business discussions, document development etc .\\n65

sized ones as I like to stick to the definition of  portable,  so this fit's the bill .\\n66

as possible unlike Qosmio 17  which is almost same size .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                      Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .\\n68

                                                  I was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I love the feel of typing on it, and have not had any issues transferring from a regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .\\n71                                                                                                                                             I was also worried that it's small size would equate to something delicate, but I am rough on my electronics, and the ASUS has handled a few rough tousles with textbooks in a bag slung into my car seat without any problems .\\n72

was also a concern, but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .\\n73                                                                                                                                         As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if
